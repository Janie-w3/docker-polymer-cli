## jefferyb/polymer-cli
This is image contains a set of necessary tools for [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/toolbox/set-up) and [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit) Development so you can get up and running developing with Polymer without installing all the tools on your own computer.

This image is built weekly, with all the latest tools...

__What's new:__
* [generator-polymer-init-custom-build](https://github.com/PolymerElements/generator-polymer-init-custom-build) - This template is a starting point for building apps using Polymer Starter Kit with a custom gulp process leveraging [polymer-build](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build), the library powering [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli).

## Build an app with App Toolbox

Using the [Polymer Project Documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/toolbox/set-up):

	Initialize & serve your project from a template
	===============================================

	1. Create a new project folder to start from

		$ mkdir my-app
		$ cd my-app

	2. Initialize your project with an app template

		$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli polymer init polymer-2-starter-kit

	3. Serve your project

		$ docker run --name polymer-project -d -p 8081:8081 -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli polymer serve -H 0.0.0.0

		and just point your browser to port 8081

	4. When you're done serving your project

		$ docker rm -f polymer-project

# How to use this image?

Go to your Polymer project folder, then execute:

```console
docker run --name polymer-project -d -p 8081:8081 -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli polymer serve -H 0.0.0.0
```

(It looks like the ports have changed from 8080 to 8081)

Once it's up and running, just point your browser to port 8081...

## Quick Tip

Since the `docker run` command is long, and if you're going to be using it often, I would suggest creating/adding an alias for it in your .bash_profile or .bashrc, like:

```console
alias polymer="docker run --name polymer-project --rm -p 8081:8081 -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli polymer "
```

and then you can just use `polymer` along with the [Polymer CLI commands](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli), like:

```console
polymer init starter-kit
```
to initialize a Polymer project from the starter-kit or one of other several templates, or

```console
polymer serve -H 0.0.0.0
```
to run a development server that you can reach at port 8081

## Polymer-CLI Commands

[Polymer-CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) includes a number of tools for working with Polymer and Web Components:

  * __init__ - Initializes a Polymer project from one of several templates
  * __build__	- Builds an application-style project
  * __lint__ - Lints the project
  * __serve__	- Runs a development server
  * __test__ - Runs tests with web-component-tester

## Tools included in this image:

This image includes:

	* LTS version (4.x) of Node.js
	* git
	* gulp
	* Bower
	* Polymer CLI
	* generator-polymer-init-custom-build

And you can make alias for them too to work with your project with something like:
```console
alias git-docker="docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli git "
alias npm-docker="docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli npm "
alias node-docker="docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli node "
alias bower-docker="docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app jefferyb/polymer-cli bower "
alias gulp-docker="docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/polymer/app -p 5000:5000 jefferyb/polymer-cli gulp "
```
and then, for example, you can use:

```console
git-docker clone https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.git
npm-docker install or npm-docker update
bower-docker install or bower-docker update
gulp-docker serve
```
and just point your browser to port 5000 to get started with Polymer Starter Kit.

## Container Shell Access

The `docker exec` command allows you to run commands inside a Docker container. The following command line will give you a bash shell inside your Polymer project container:

```console
docker exec -it polymer-project bash
```

If you want to connect as root (for example to install a package), then execute:

```console
docker exec -it -u root polymer-project bash
```
